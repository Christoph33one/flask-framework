      <p>On April 26, 2941, Gandalf and the Dwarves arrived at Bag End. After a big tea and supper with Bilbo, they
        explained themselves and their intentions. Bilbo was at first reluctant to join the group but Gandalf rushed him
        out of the door.

            After traveling for some time and crossing the river Hoarwell, the company were caught and nearly killed and
            eaten by three hungry trolls. Gandalf returned in time to keep the monsters occupied until dawn when the
            light
            of the Sun turned them to stone. Recovering themselves, the Dwarves found that these Trolls had a cave
            nearby
            filled with stolen weapons, food, and a small treasure. Amongst the many weapons were Sting (which Bilbo
            armed
            himself with, and which he named after a battle with a giant spider), Orcrist (claimed by Thorin), and
            Glamdring
            (taken by Gandalf). Remarkably, all were ancient Elvish blades that had been forged several millennia
            earlier,
            in the First Age in Gondolin.

          Reaching Rivendell in June, the company held talks with Elrond and learned about the secret Moon-letters on
          Thorins old map of the Lonely Mountain. Elrond also read the runes on Orcrist and Glamdring, thus identifying
          them. After spending a short time there, the group resumed their journey over the Misty Mountains.

          On their way through the High Pass, the company (minus Gandalf) were captured by Goblins. Taken before the
          Great Goblin, they were in mortal danger. Gandalf suddenly appeared and killed the Great Goblin, creating
          enough disarray for them to escape. Unfortunately, Bilbo fell down a hole and was left behind during their
          hasty retreat. Wandering lost and alone in the depths of the mountain, he found the One Ring and met Gollum,
          described in The Hobbit as "a small slimy creature â€¦ as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes
          in his thin face."
          </p>
          <p>
          After a hazardous game of Riddles with the creature, Bilbo fortuitously discovered the Ring he had found could
          make him invisible. Wearing the Ring, Bilbo escaped Gollum and a group of goblins guarding the eastern door
          out of the caverns and soon reunited with his companions. Collecting themselves, the company made their way
          down the mountainside, where they were attacked by Wargs and forced to seek refuge in the trees. Goblins soon
          arrived and tried to kill the company by getting them down on the ground by tampering down the trees. With all
          hope nearly gone, the hapless company was rescued by a group of giant Eagles.
